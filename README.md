# Hashmap vs vec
When comparing the performance of lookups in a HashMap and a Vec, there are a few key factors to consider that can explain why you might see a HashMap lookup being slower than a Vec lookup in your benchmarks:
1. Data Structure Overhead

    HashMap: A HashMap is a hash-based data structure that has overhead associated with hashing the keys and handling collisions. This overhead can make lookups slower, especially when the hash function is not optimal or if there are many collisions.
    Vec: A Vec is a contiguous array in memory. Accessing an element by index is an O(1) operation and usually faster than the hash-based lookup since it does not involve hashing or collision resolution.

2. Key Distribution and Size

    If the keys in the HashMap are randomly generated and there are many collisions, this can degrade the performance of the lookup operation. A well-distributed hash function should minimize this issue.
    The size of the data also plays a role; if the HashMap is small (e.g., 10,000 entries), the overhead of hashing might outweigh the benefits of using a hash table compared to a direct index access in a Vec.

3. Memory Access Patterns

    Access patterns for Vec are usually more cache-friendly because the data is stored contiguously in memory, leading to better CPU cache performance. In contrast, the underlying storage of a HashMap is not contiguous.

4. Benchmarking Methodology

    Ensure that you are correctly measuring the performance. If the hash function is not well-optimized, it may lead to slower lookups.
    In your benchmarks, the use of black_box() prevents the compiler from optimizing away the operations, but it’s essential to ensure that you're testing real-world scenarios.

5. Testing Environment

    The performance can also depend on the specific system and environment where you're running the benchmarks. Different machines might exhibit different performance characteristics due to variations in CPU architecture, cache sizes, etc.

Suggestions for Improvement

    Increase Sample Size: Sometimes larger datasets can give you a clearer picture of performance differences.
    Profile Performance: Use profiling tools to investigate where time is being spent in your benchmark. This can help you identify whether hashing, collisions, or memory access patterns are causing delays.
    Experiment with Different Key Types: If you change the type of keys or their distribution, you might see different performance characteristics.

Conclusion

It’s not uncommon for Vec lookups to outperform HashMap lookups, especially with small to moderately sized datasets. If you need to perform a lot of lookups and insertions, consider your specific use case and whether the trade-offs are worth it based on the expected size and access patterns of your data.
